More than 3,000 people have been infected with the disease since and no fatalities have been reported so far. Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that mainly infects cattle, swine, goats, sheep and dogs. Humans can get infected if they come in direct contact with infected animals or by eating or drinking contaminated animal products or by inhaling airborne agents. According to the WHO, most cases of the disease are caused by ingesting unpasteurised milk or cheese from infected goats or sheep. Symptoms of the disease include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache and muscle pain. While some signs and symptoms can last for long periods of time, others may never go away. These include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicles and scrotum area, swelling of the heart, neurologic symptoms, chronic fatigue, depression and swelling of the liver or spleen.

Local outbreaks of many outbreaks Traceable investigation found what;,2020-10-20,,China,,"36.567, 103.93",covid19,,http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-10/20/c_1126634228.htm,"Observation | The local epidemic survey of many outbreaks and traceability investigations found on October 17th. When the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a news, when tracing the Qingdao epidemic, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was detected from the outer packaging positive samples of the imported frozen cod carried by the workers.Live virus.This confirms that the external packaging contaminated by the new crown virus can cause infection.On October 18th, the traceability of Wang, who was asymptomatic in Guangzhou, also concluded that Wang's infected virus gene sequence was highly homologous to the virus gene sequence of virus genes found by the isolation hotel where it worked.A infection stems from an overseas input case of isolated hotels.Since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, the Northeast China (Suifenhe and Jilin Shilan), Beijing Xinfa, Xinjiang Urumqi, Dalian, Liaoning, and Qingdao, Shandong have successively appeared in small -scale clustering cases.What did the traceability survey discovered in these local outbreaks? In the situation of exceeding 40 million confirmed cases worldwide, and new cases of new cases in a single day, what should my country's epidemic prevention and control should pay special attention to and prevent? Reporters interviewed China Experts from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.The new coronal virus triggered the epidemic in October 11 with cold chain items as a carrier. On October 11, 3 cases of new coronary pneumonia were infected with unsecured infections in Qingdao City, Shandong Province.Where does the sudden new crown virus come from the attention of all parties?After 72 consecutive hours of investigation, the ""Case"" finally came out: During the observation of the two new crown virus infected in Qingdao Port, the two new -crown virus infected in Qingdao's thoracic hospital, left the closed ward for a CT examination.The virus is contaminated, and then the inpatients and accompanying patients who have been infected with the tuberculosis area in the same CT room the next day, and put the virus belt into the tuberculosis wiring area, causing the epidemic to spread within the hospital.As the ""Zero Patient"" of the Qingdao epidemic, Dong Moumou and Chen Moumou are the Qingdao Dagang loading and unloading workers. On September 19, the night shift loaded and unloaded frozen seafood imported from overseas.The Qingdao Center for Disease Control and Prevention samples the working environment of the two.According to the samples they collected, experts from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Center detect the live virus from the positive samples of the imported frozen cod from the imported frozen cod by the workers.In June of this year, after 56 consecutive days without adding local diagnosis cases in Beijing, local cases appeared again.Local cases appeared after the case. Nearly 80 % of the confirmed cases in the first five days were employees and family members of Kaiyang Seafood Company.Experts analyze that frozen -storeed pollution import sea products are likely to play an important role in the trigger and spread of the two places.However, although the epidemic traceability survey was detected, the positive samples of cold chain aquatic products and outer packaging nucleic acid were detected, but the live virus was never separated, and the transmission chain and the evidence chain were not complete.This time from Qingdao Cold Chain Foods, the live virus is separated from the international internationally internationally.This suggests that the new coronal virus can be cold -chain items as the carrier of long -distance cross -border input, and also confirmed that the outer packaging contaminated by the new crown virus can cause infection.""In the past, the"" coronary virus nucleic acid positive in the sample, the positive of nucleic acid positive is not necessarily a living virus.Director Gao Fu said.""From the cold chain food outer packaging, the virus is separated from the virus, from a scientific perspective: one is to indicate that the new coronary virus can survive for a long time in the physical environment of the cold chain.The situation input caused the spread of the epidemic; the second is to provide the most direct scientific basis for triggering the new crown or clustered epidemic in food and outer packaging that are contaminated by new crown virus and cross -border transportation through cold chains.Wu Zunyou, the chief expert of Xuexue, explained that the main way to spread the new crown virus is still through respiratory tract droplets and close contact.In the place, the virus is brought in by pollutants, and people have developed a new ""Zero Case"" due to exposure to pollutants, thereby triggering the clustered new crown epidemic or outbreak.After triggering the epidemic, the main way to spread the spread of the epidemic is the heir to the people (through the droplets).Liu Peipei, deputy director of the P3 Laboratory of the China Centers for Disease Control and Control Center, which is separated by the separation of environmental sample virus, explained whether it can be separated from the virus and affected by various factors, including the degree of pollution of items, the time from overseas to domestic, etc.Wait, ""for example, moving seafood from the freezer to the freezer, usually pass through the room temperature environment. It is colder than that in June and July in 19 October. The virus survival time is greater, and the probability of separating the virus is greater.""Since the epidemic occurred, Qingdao immediately organized a large -scale flow inspection and classification test.The picture shows Qingdao Red Wheat Island Change detection point, and citizens are lined up in an orderly manner for nucleic acid testing.According to Li Zhongjie, a researcher at the Infectious Division of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are three characteristics of the Qingdao epidemic: First, the virus comes from overseas input, which is the same communication chain; the other is to occur in specific places, which is limited to the scope; and third, case discovery will be disposed of quickly in time.It did not cause community communication.Wu Zunyou also pointed out that the particularity of the Qingdao epidemic was that the first two people who were infected did not cause the epidemic to spread a larger scope in the cold chain industry.This also helps to eliminate other possibilities about the source of the epidemic, and it is confirmed that the epidemic is because the polluted seafood transported to the country through the cold chain and caused spread.Foreign defense input should emphasize that ""the characters are separated from the cold chain food from the outer packaging of the cold chain food, which means what does this mean?"" This indicates that the prevention and control strategy of our external defense input and internal defense rebound is correct. ""Wu Zunyou explained thatNow that foreign defense input emphasizes that ""the character is equal"", that is, people who are not only infected from overseas infections are from returning to the country to cause local spread and spread, but also to prevent frozen foods contaminated abroad to transport the virus to the country through cold chain transportation.Necessary.The separation virus this time is on the outer packaging of the imported frozen cod, and imported seafood has attracted special attention.Wu Zunyou reminded that this does not mean that meat food imported through cold chains does not bring the risk of virus.""Earlier in Europe and the United States, many meat food processing companies outbreaked for a clustered epidemic. If they did not regulate epidemic prevention when re -production, beef and mutton, chicken, etc. from the country of severe countries, it may also transport the virus belt through cold chain transportation through cold chain transportation.In China, it is not allowed to test the detection of meat food. ""Wu Zunyou said.For ordinary people, can import sea products and meat foods still eat? Experts from China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that the new crown virus possibilities have long -distance cross -border input with cold chain items, but their infected risk people are mainly cold chain items.Persons, such as the loading and unloading, processing, sales, etc., such as cold chain products, etc., ordinary public contacts or consumption of cold chain food infection are extremely low.The data released by the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the risk of being contaminated by new crown virus in my country's market circulation was very low.As of September 15th, 24 provinces across the country have submitted 2.98 million test results, including 670,000 cold chain food and packaging samples, 1.24 million samples of employees, 1.07 million environmental samples, only 22 foods and packaging.The new coronary virus nucleic acid was positive, and the virus nucleic acid load was low.""Live viruses, dead viruses, and virus fragments can detect nucleic acid positive, but only the living virus is contagious. 22 nucleic acid positives were detected from 2.98 million copies, and there was no separate virus.The risk of infection epidemic can almost ignore it.Before touching the mouth, mouth, nose and eyes.For industry employees who often closely contact with cold chain products with high new coronary virus pollution in the work, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that they strengthen their awareness of protection and do daily protection.For example, to avoid the skin that may be contaminated directly in the skin. After contacting the cold chain products, it does not take off the pollution workwear and do not touch the nose and eyes before washing the hands. After the work is completed, you need to wash your hands and disinfect it.Strengthen the closed -loop management of overseas input cases so that the ward isolates. Recently, Shandong Yantai border inspection agencies go through the border inspection process overseas in order to prevent and control the epidemic, and go through the border inspection procedures for 400,000 tons of giant wheels from Brazil.In response to the situation of more than 20 Chinese crew members in the round, the border inspection agencies sent multiple groups of duty personnel to conduct personnel inspections on board and off -off crew members to ensure that the shipping crew can receive nucleic acid testing as soon as possible.At present, the world is still in a peak period, and new cases are newly high in a single day.Data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of the early morning of October 20, Beijing time, a total of more than 40.15 million cumulative cases in the world have exceeded 1.15 million cases.In the past 7 days, more than 2.5 million newly confirmed cases in various countries are the highest weekly new number since the emergence of new crown pneumonia.According to the new crown epidemic data released by the World Health Organization, as of 1:43 on October 18, Beijing time, the number of new crowns in the world increased by 392,471 cases from the previous day.New high.The World Health Organization Director -General Tan Desai said at a regular press conference that as the northern hemisphere enters the winter, there are many new crowns in many places, especially in Europe and North America.""At present, the second wave of epidemic rebound in the world is obvious, and external prevention input is the focus of the current epidemic prevention and control. Autumn and winter is the season of high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. The prevention and control situation is even more severe.Blessing.Recently, the local epidemic has exposed shortcomings and loopholes in the prevention and control of the normalized epidemic.For example, Qingdao's new crown virus infection shares the CT room with patients with ordinary ward.For another example, Wang Hua's infection was infected without any symptoms of infected infected because he did not carry out protection in accordance with the specifications when assisting parts of the isolation of the hotel.It is not standardized and has a close communication with the isolated person.""At present, China's social environment should be said to be safer, only new crown viruses like customs, hospitals, and laboratories. Pay special attention to the following risk points to prevent and control."" Wu Zunyou reminded that the closed loop of input cases abroadIn terms of management, pay attention to the isolation of the diseased area to prevent the risk of cross -infection.The management of overseas input cases in various places has a designated hospital or designated hospital. Some of the designated hospitals are specially accepted by new crown cases. There are also services to other patients in society while receiving new crown input cases.In the latter case, pay attention to whether the division of the ward is strictly isolated, whether large instrument and equipment are used in cross use, and all localities must conduct one -stop examination of hospitals receiving input cases to see if there is a loophole in the entire closed loop.In terms of laboratory protection, the laboratory operation should be done in accordance with regulations, and at the same time, there must be a hidden danger of the closed loop of the epidemic prevention and control., Wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining social distance is still important.New crown virus infections that have recently appeared in local areas, such as Qingdao Port workers Dong Moumou and Chen Moumou, and Wang Mou, who are infected with Guangzhou, are asymptomatic. What does this mean?Early in the early days of the epidemic, people were paying more attention to timely extinguishing the epidemic and treating patients in a timely manner.Among the subsequent epidemics, the proportion of asyptically infected infections increased. This is actually due to the movement of the epidemic prevention and control window and the improvement of the detection capacity, so that we can find cases in the early infection in a timely manner.""After more than 9 months of practice, my country has accumulated effective early prevention and control experience. Even if there is an epidemic, there will be no serious epidemic like Wuhan in the early days of Wuhan. We have the confidence to deal with the test of the autumn and winter epidemic."" Wu Zunyou explain.The new idea of ​​providing new ideas for the mystery of the traceability of the new crown virus has lasted for a long time without local reports. Why did the outbreak suddenly outbreak? Expert analysis pointed out two possibilities: First, infected from the epidemic area caused input to inputSexual communication; the second is that the polluting seafood or meat foods are transported to the domestic market through the cold chain.""The epidemic situation in several cities in Northeast China basically belongs to the local communication caused by input cases. Beijing, Dalian, Qingdao and other local epidemic conditions are basically transported from the polluted seafood or outer packaging through the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to""Wu Zunyou said"" Wu Zunyou said.Earlier, a large number of new crown viruses were detected in the South China seafood market, and people had suspected that the epidemic was related to wild animals.However, with the deepening of the understanding of the new crown virus, experts believe that it is necessary to further broaden their ideas and incorporate some new technical directions into the research scope.In June this year, the epidemic rebounded in Beijing, and it also set out a concentrated on the wholesale market. However, the possibility of wild animals caused the epidemic in Beijing, and the survey of the epidemic traceability finally pointed to the cold chain food.Since then, the epidemic in Dalian and Qingdao has been related to seafood.""Early surveys in Wuhan, cases in the South China Seafood Market are also concentrated in practitioners in the sea product sales area. In the past, our virus trace the source of more considering wild animals. Today, some new epidemiology data and laboratory data remind us.In addition to the previous technical routes, the virus traceability should also be considered, such as whether it is possible, in addition to the previous technical lines, it is possible that seafood is possible.(Han Yadong, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection)"
