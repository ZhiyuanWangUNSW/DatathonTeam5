Health chiefs warn Brits to stay off school or work if feeling ill as winter bugs surge,3/01/2023,,United Kingdom,,"51.5, -0.126",covid19,,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/health-chiefs-warn-brits-stay-28856890,1,,,,,,"winter bugs, surge","Brits have been told to stay off work or school if unwell amid surging winter bugs - with hospital flu cases nearly doubling in a week. The UK Health Security Agency has issued the advice as schools and workplaces reopen after the festive break.  It comes amid high and increasing rates of flu, Covid-19, norovirus, scarlet fever and versions of the common cold. Prof Susan Hopkins, UKHSA chief medical adviser, said: ""It's important to minimise the spread of infection in schools and other education and childcare settings as much as possible.  ""If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better and the fever has resolved. ""Adults should also try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wear a face covering. When unwell don't visit healthcare settings unless urgent, or visit vulnerable people."" Low levels of natural immunity following three years of restricted social mixing are thought to be contributing to a high flu season. Patients in hospital with flu have increased 79% in a week.  An average of 3,746 people with flu were in hospital across the seven days to 25 December, up from 2,088 the previous week, according to NHS England.  Covid rates are rising with a 22% increase in hospital admissions recorded in England between 7 and 14 December.  A host of infections are also circulating such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and seasonal coronaviruses that can cause fever, sore throat, ear infections, headaches and coughing.  The UKHSA is calling on parents to teach young children how to wash their hands properly. Prof Hopkins said: ""Helping children to learn about the importance of good hand hygiene is also key, so practise regular hand washing at home with soap and warm water. ""Catching coughs and sneezes in tissues then binning them is another simple way to help stop illness from spreading."" Strep A infections are circulating which can lead to scarlet fever and in very rare cases, serious complications.  At least 30 children have died in the UK from invasive strep A since September - which has triggered a run on hospitals and GP surgeries from concerned parents.  The main strain of influenza circulating in the UK is H3N2, which has been linked to more severe disease, particularly in vulnerable groups such as elderly people and young children. The current flu vaccine broadly covers this strain. Those eligible include children aged 2 and 3 on 31 August 2022, all primary school-aged children and some secondary school-aged children. Prof Hopkins added: ""Remember that flu vaccination is still available for all eligible groups and is the best protection against the virus. We have seen good uptake in older age groups but vaccination among young children remains low. ""Flu can be very unpleasant and in some cases can lead to more serious illness. Getting your child vaccinated protects them and others they come into contact with and it's still not too late."" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories"

Incidents have been confirmed near Hadleigh, Suffolk and in Northwold and Honington, which are either side of the county border near Thetford, Norfolk. It follows outbreaks at Honington, Bury St Edmunds and Attleborough a week ago. Christine Middlemiss said it was vital biosecurity measures were followed to help prevent the spread of the virus. A 1.9-mile (3km) protection zone and a six-mile (10km) surveillance zone has been placed around all premises and the affected birds will be humanely culled, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. ""It's certainly unusual to have this many [national] cases confirmed at this time of year. It's a disease we usually see in the winter when migratory birds return from where they've been over the summer,"" said Ms Middlemiss. ""It's a very concerning level of infection out there at the moment."" She added a ""huge amount of infection"" earlier this year led to a disease ""hangover"" in the summer among wild birds which do not migrate. ""That's why we're seeing these clusters pop up,"" she explained. ""[A case of bird flu] usually means there's a regional really high level of wild bird infection and those birds have gone to different farms and caused infection there."" She added keepers of birds needed to make sure they were ""clean all the time"" during day-to-day tasks with their birds, including cleaning footwear when going from coop to coop. Defra has previously said the virus was ""primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public's health is very low"". Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Getting Answers: doctors seeing rise in gastroenteritis cases - Western Mass News,19/11/2022,,United States,,"38.89, -77.032",,Acute gastroenteritis,https://www.westernmassnews.com/2022/11/18/getting-answers-doctors-seeing-rise-gastroenteritis-cases/,84,,,,gastroenteritis,,rise,"SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - With cold and flu season ramping up, healthcare workers across the Bay State are seeing a rise in all sorts of viruses and illnesses, including gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis, commonly known as the stomach flu, is one of the many viruses that is getting us sick this cold and flu season. While it is not uncommon, many health experts we spoke with said they are expecting to see it in higher amounts than normal this winter season. ""Of the stomach virus, or gastroenteritis, we are seeing that mixed in with a whole bunch of other things that is going around, such as the flu or even COVID, which can often present with very similar symptoms,"" said Lawrence Benjamin, a physician assistant with AFC Urgent Care. Benjamin told us although it's often referred to as the stomach flu, that can be misleading since the virus is not related to influenza. ""We do get vaccinated against Influenza A and B, hopefully, and it does cause similar symptoms and it can just be GI symptoms or gastroenteritis symptoms...No, the influenza vaccines, the flu A and B vaccines, won't really protect you against gastroenteritis,"" Benjamin added. Some common gastroenteritis symptoms are stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting, and fever. Benjamin told Western Mass News that the stomach flu can look like other infections, like the flu or COVID-19, and often increase this time of year. ""With every seasonal change, you can always expect an increase in any infection related to season prevalence, including the stomach bug,"" Benjamin noted. Benjamin said the best way to prevent getting seriously sick this season is to get your COVID-19 and flu vaccines. He also said it's important because it is possible to get more than one of these illnesses at the same time. Copyright 2022. Western Mass News (WGGB/WSHM). All rights reserved."

The numbers are a slight increase on the previous day's figures, with 5551 reported on Sunday. However, it is the second day in a row the State has woken to welcome news of a zero-death 24 hours. There are now 240 people in hospital and six in the intensive care unit. The new cases were distributed across all State regions, with the bulk of the new infections arising in the metropolitan area (4640). That was followed by the South West (452 new cases), Mid West (114 new cases), Great Southern (88 new cases), Pilbara (87 new cases), Goldfields (84 new cases), Kimberley (82 new cases) and Wheatbelt (72 new cases). There are now 43,524 active COVID cases in WA. The latest COVID update comes as WA's private and public hospitals prepare to resume elective surgery for non-essential procedures after indoor mask mandates were lifted on Friday. From Monday, private hospitals will resume taking bookings for these procedures, with public hospitals following suit a week later. Category 2 and 3 procedures include knee and hip replacements, as well as ear, nose and throat procedures. In addition to the good news, close contacts of COVID cases can now pick up another 10 free rapid antigen tests. As part of WA's relaxing of restrictions, asymptomatic close contacts are no longer required to isolate for seven days but must wear a mask outside their home, avoid high-risk settings such as hospitals and return a negative RAT each day. The McGowan Government, which spent $500 million on 110 million RATs, initially sent five free swabs to homes that registered for the giveaway and then boosted that to 15 RATs in mid-March. As of Sunday, close contacts with no symptoms could collect RATs from vaccination clinics at Claremont, Midland, Armadale, Kwinana, Joondalup, Mirrabooka, Ellenbrook, Mandurah and the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre.
